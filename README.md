* Purpose: Database schema and updates.  
* Tables: Users, internships, applications, skills, admin, categories, internships etc.

4. ## **Libraries and Technologies Used**

* PHP:  Core backend logic.  
* PDO/MySQLi:  Database access.  
* HTML/CSS:  Frontend structure and styling.  
* JavaScript: (If present) for interactivity.

5. ##  **How the Code Works (Flow Example)**

* **User Registration/Login**: User registers via register.php, logs in via login.php. Session is started and user role is set.  
* **Dashboard Access**: Based on role, user is redirected to the appropriate dashboard (student/, company/, admin/).  
* **Internship Management**: Companies post internships, students view and apply, admins oversee.  
* **Application Handling**: Students apply/withdraw, companies view/manage applications.  
* **Profile and Skills:** Users update their profiles and skills for better matching.
